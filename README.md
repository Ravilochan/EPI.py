## Tracking progress

The file [index.html](https://github.com/Ravilochan/EPI.py/blob/master/index.html) at the root of this project tracks your progress through the problems. Specifically, there's an expanding tab for each chapter. Click on it, and you will see your progress, e.g., as below. This file gets updated each time you execute a program. You can **use this file to map book problems to stub programs**.
